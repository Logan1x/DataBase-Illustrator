## DataBase Illustrator
An web app based on python to show data and user handling.This is a python-script made with framework flask, which performs actions on form inputs received from user and stores it in a SQLite3, and also reads and retrieve data to display it in html file. All these stuff enables it as a real-time database illusion. It looks like as if we have a real storage of our data somewhere in a real database. To conclude and have an exact User-Interface for data-base we can view the data of csv file in excel sheets, Libre-Office or Google spreadheets etc.
